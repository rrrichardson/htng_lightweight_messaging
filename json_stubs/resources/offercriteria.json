//TODO: define the concept of the "offer criteria", which is a combination of stay, search and profile data, sequence how the the context is created, and how it interacts with auth events / profile

// The ID portion URI returned by the POST to offer context can be passed in to /offers as a query parameter
// open question: should we allow encoded JSON to be passed in as a parameter representing an ad-hoc offer context

// open question: since we're "Creating" offers that are custom to that user's offer context, perhaps this should be a POST (however this would be odd in the fact that a list of offers is returned)
